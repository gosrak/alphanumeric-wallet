//! Run an external command whenever this node's chain tip changes.
//!
//! This is Bitcoin Core's `-blocknotify` contract, deliberately: every Stratum
//! backend — CKPool, NOMP, Yiimp, MiningCore — has consumed that interface since
//! 2011, so a pool points its existing script at this node and is done. Inventing
//! a bespoke long-poll or websocket would have obliged every integrator to write
//! new code for this chain alone.
//!
//! WHY IT EXISTS. A solo miner that learns of a new block late wastes one
//! miner's work. A Stratum pool that learns late keeps handing out work on the
//! stale parent to every connected miner, so one node's detection delay is
//! multiplied by the pool's entire hashrate. Without a push, a pool's only option
//! is polling `/explorer/tip`, and a node that is not richly peered otherwise
//! learns the tip from the 3-second beacon poll — 1.5s on average, which at a 5s
//! block target is 30% of an interval spent mining a parent that is already dead.
//! This turns that into a millisecond-scale push.
//!
//! WHY IT CANNOT AFFECT CONSENSUS. It is a read-only observer of a signal emitted
//! AFTER a block has already been applied. It does not validate, select, relay or
//! decide anything, and nothing consults its result — it has no return value that
//! any caller reads. A hook that can only observe cannot change what a node
//! accepts, so a node with it configured and a node without compute identical
//! chains. There is nothing here to prove with a test because there is no path
//! from this module back into block acceptance.
//!
//! THE ONE REAL HAZARD is back-pressure: a hook that blocked block application
//! would be far worse than the problem it solves. Four things prevent that, none
//! of them relying on the operator's script behaving:
//!
//!   * The tip signal is a `tokio::watch`. A watch sender NEVER blocks on a slow
//!     receiver — it overwrites. Ingest cannot be stalled by this task even in
//!     principle.
//!   * The loop below is single-flight by construction: at most one child process
//!     exists at any moment, so a hanging script cannot fork-bomb the machine.
//!     (Bitcoin's spawns are unbounded; this is deliberately stricter.)
//!   * Slow hooks COALESCE rather than queue. While a hook runs, further tip
//!     changes overwrite each other in the watch, so the next iteration fires once
//!     with the CURRENT tip. A pool is never handed a backlog of dead parents —
//!     which is exactly the failure this feature exists to prevent, and would be
//!     the ironic result of using an mpsc channel here instead.
//!   * A hook that outlives `HOOK_TIMEOUT` is killed. Bitcoin does not do this and
//!     it is a known way to leak processes forever.
//!
//! Stdout and stderr go to `/dev/null` on purpose. Inheriting them would let a
//! chatty script interleave into the client's own display, and PIPING them without
//! draining would deadlock the child once it filled the pipe buffer — a classic
//! trap in `blocknotify` reimplementations. A hook that wants to log should
//! redirect inside itself.
