# alphanumeric node API (explorer + transaction submit)

A read-only chain API plus a transaction-submit endpoint, for building explorers,
web wallets, and exchange integrations **on top of a node you run**. It is
**opt-in**: a node serves this only when started with `ALPHANUMERIC_EXPLORER_API`.
The public gateway (alphanumeric.blue) and the reference publisher do NOT run it,
and enabling it changes no consensus or network behavior — submit-tx reuses the
same validation and gossip path the built-in `create` command uses.

## Enabling

    ALPHANUMERIC_EXPLORER_API=8787 ./alphanumeric          # bind 127.0.0.1:8787
    ALPHANUMERIC_EXPLORER_API=0.0.0.0:8787 ./alphanumeric  # all interfaces (put a
                                                           # reverse proxy in front)

It binds loopback by default. The API is unauthenticated and serves public chain
data; if you expose it publicly, front it with your own proxy (TLS, auth on
submit-tx, rate limits). The node already applies a coarse submit-tx flood guard
and a per-sender mempool rate limit, but a public deployment should add its own.

## Read endpoints (GET)

| Endpoint | Returns |
|---|---|
| `/explorer/status` | node/chain status: version, network_id, height, `finalized_height` + `finality_margin` (see Finality below), index readiness, mining status (see Mining status below) |
| `/explorer/tip` | latest block, including display-form transactions |
| `/explorer/block/{height}` | full block at height (canonical) |
| `/explorer/tx/{height}/{position}` | one transaction by block height + position (includes `final`) |
| `/explorer/tx?id={tx_id}` | track one transaction by id: `confirmed` (with height, position, block_hash, confirmations, `final`, body), `pending` (in mempool), or 404 |
| `/explorer/address/{address}` | confirmed **balance** + paginated tx **history** |
| `/explorer/supply` | total confirmed positive balances, including immature mining rewards |
| `/explorer/fee-estimate` | advisory next-block fee recommendation priced off this node's live mempool (see Fees below) |

`/explorer/address/{address}` query params: `limit` (1–200, default 50) and a
`before_height` + `before_pos` cursor (pass both) for pagination. Response
includes `balance`, `balance_units` (exact integer string), and `transactions`.

Amounts appear both as a decimal `amount`/`balance` and an exact integer
`*_units` string — **use the `_units` integer for accounting**; the decimal is
for display (floats lose precision).

The address/supply financial reads, and the address-index metadata reported by
status, fail closed when their local database or derived index cannot answer.
Treat either `503` response as unavailable data and retry/alert; never substitute
zero or an empty transaction list:

    503  {"error": "chain busy, retry shortly"}  chain lock contended
    503  {"error": "storage_unavailable"}        storage/index read failed

A genuinely absent address still returns a successful zero balance. An address
index that has never completed returns `history_available: false` and
`transactions: null`; neither condition is a storage error.

## Mining status

`/explorer/status` reports what this node is mining, if anything.

| field | |
|---|---|
| `mining` | always present. `false` means this node is not mining |
| `mining_address` | the wallet this session is mining **for**. Present only while mining. Not necessarily where the coinbase goes — see `mining_payout_rotation` |
| `mining_backend` | `"gpu"` or `"cpu"`. Present only while mining. It follows a mid-session demotion: a GPU that dies under load falls back to the CPU scan and this becomes `"cpu"` |
| `mining_hps` | hashes per second. Present only while mining; `0` means mining but not yet measured, or between rounds (backoff, block absorption, prep) when nothing is hashing |
| `mining_blocks` | blocks mined **in this mining session**. Present only while mining. A new session (a second `mine` in the interactive loop) restarts it at zero; a headless node has exactly one session per process, so there it is also per-process |
| `mining_payout_rotation` | `true` when a coinbase payout rotation is configured (`ALPHANUMERIC_COINBASE_PAYOUTS`). Present only while mining |

The five detail fields are **absent**, not null, when `mining` is `false` —
so "not mining" and "mining but the figure is unknown" cannot be confused.

When `mining_payout_rotation` is `true`, **the coinbase does not pay
`mining_address`**: the recipient is a height-dependent address taken from the
schedule (slot at `height % total_weight`), so it changes block to block and
`mining_address` is only the wallet the session was started for. When it is
`false`, the coinbase pays `mining_address`.

**`mining_address` is a payout address on an unauthenticated endpoint.** A node
that binds the explorer to anything but loopback publishes the link between its
IP and that wallet, and `/explorer/address/{address}` on the same router then
serves that wallet's balance and full transaction history to anyone who asks.
Keep the explorer on loopback (or behind an authenticating proxy) if that link
should not be public.

`mining_hps` is hashes per second and nothing else. The GPU miner reports
GH/s and the CPU miner MH/s on their own progress bars; the wire carries
neither, because a consumer guessing wrong between them is wrong by a
factor of a thousand.

## Finality (for exchanges — credit deposits safely)

The chain finalizes history behind a trusted checkpoint: **blocks at or below
`finalized_height` cannot be reorged by this node** — a reorg at/below that height
is rejected outright. It is monotonic (never regresses), and it is **this node's
own view**.

**`finality_margin` is how far the checkpoint is placed behind the tip when it
moves — not how far behind it sits.** The checkpoint advances on two events: a
block this node received from the network extended its tip, or the node converged
with a signed beacon. **Mining a block yourself does not advance it.** Between
those events the tip keeps rising and the checkpoint does not, so the real gap is
`finality_margin` plus every block since the last such event.

How large that gets depends on how much of the chain the node mines itself: the
bigger its own share, the rarer those events are. On a node mining a substantial
fraction, gaps of hundreds to thousands of blocks are ordinary and quiet stretches
of several hours occur; a gap far above 64 is normal operation, not a fault, and
not a signal that the node is unhealthy. **Budget hours, not minutes, for a
deposit to reach `final: true`**, and read freshness from `blocks_behind` — which
does track the tip continuously — rather than from the size of the finality gap.

- **`/explorer/status`** reports `finalized_height` and `finality_margin`.
- **`/explorer/tx?id=`** and **`/explorer/tx/{height}/{position}`** include a
  boolean **`final`** = (`height` ≤ `finalized_height`).

**Credit a deposit as irreversible when its `final` is `true` AND the node is
fresh.** `final` is a strong signal, but it reflects the finality of the chain
*this node is on*. A node that is eclipsed or on the losing side of a network
partition keeps advancing its own checkpoint on that minority chain, so it can
report `final: true` for a transaction the majority chain later reorgs away —
the one direction that costs an exchange money. Guard against it: only trust
`final` when `/explorer/status` shows healthy freshness (`network_height` present
and `blocks_behind` small, 0–1), and run your own well-connected node with a seed
peer configured. On a healthy, majority-connected node, once `final` is `true` it
never reverts.

**Reorg handling:** a transaction that is confirmed but not yet `final` can still
be reorged out. When that happens `/explorer/tx?id=` moves `confirmed → pending`
(it is returned to the mempool for re-mining) or `404`, and `confirmations` can
decrease. **Always re-poll; never cache a one-time `confirmed`.**

**A `404` does not prove the transaction is gone.** The id→height registry behind
`/explorer/tx?id=` is a rolling recent-confirmed window: an entry is pruned once the
confirming block's timestamp falls more than ~6h05m (`MAX_TX_AGE_SECS` 21,600 s +
`MAX_BLOCK_FUTURE_TIME` 300 s) behind the tip. Past that window a permanently confirmed,
finalized transaction ALSO answers `404 not_found`. Never read a `404` as "dropped, safe to
resubmit" for anything submitted more than a few hours ago — a worker that was down for six
hours and re-polls on restart would otherwise read a landed payment as reorged away and
reissue it. Once you have seen `confirmed` with a height, record `(height, position)` and
re-verify with `/explorer/tx/{height}/{position}` or `/explorer/address/{address}`; those
read the chain directly and never expire.

## Submit a transaction (POST /explorer/submit-tx)

Body: a signed transaction as JSON. Read responses are display-oriented
(`from`/`to`) and are not valid submit payloads; construct this client-side
shape explicitly:

```json
{
  "sender": "<40-char lowercase hex address>",
  "recipient": "<40-char lowercase hex address>",
  "amount": 1.5,
  "fee": 0.001,
  "timestamp": 1783600000,
  "signature": "<hex ML-DSA-87 signature>",
  "pub_key": "<hex ML-DSA public key>",
  "sig_hash": "<hex>"
}
```

The `fee` is a priority signal with a **relay floor of 0.0001 coins** — lower
fees are rejected at admission (`400 … below the relay floor`). For ordinary
payments, query **`GET /explorer/fee-estimate`** and put its **`recommended_fee`**
value in the transaction's `fee` field — the same recommendation the reference
wallet uses when `create` is run without `--fee`.

> **The wire `fee` field is a decimal coin amount, not units.** Send
> `"fee": 0.0002`. The `*_units` integers in the estimate response are for exact
> accounting only (1 coin = 100,000,000 units); putting `20000` in the `fee`
> field would sign a **20,000-coin** fee.

The estimate prices next-block inclusion off the node's live mempool against the
exact template-selection rules:

- quiet network (capacity absorbs the backlog *and* your transaction): a flat
  anchor of `0.0002` coins (`20,000` units, 2x the relay floor — strictly ahead
  of floor-paying bulk templates);
- congested: one unit above the weakest fee that still fits the next block;
- always clamped to the automatic ceiling of `0.002` coins (`200,000` units).
  Only an explicitly chosen fee may exceed it, up to the reference wallet's
  `0.01` explicit ceiling.

Response fields: `recommended_fee`/`recommended_fee_units`,
`anchor_fee`/`anchor_fee_units`, `floor_fee`/`floor_fee_units`,
`auto_cap_fee`/`auto_cap_fee_units`, `explicit_cap_fee`/`explicit_cap_fee_units`,
`congested`, `pending_candidates`, `next_block_fits`, and `basis` (`"quiet"` or
`"next-block"`). Offline fallback: use the `0.0002` anchor. Exchange withdrawal
systems may instead choose an absolute fee appropriate to their batching and
service policy, subject to current node admission and block-accounting rules.
Miners can use fees to prioritize transactions when blocks are contested, but
paying far above the recommendation does not guarantee a particular confirmation
time.

Submission is idempotent: retrying the identical signed transaction cannot
create a second payment, and a processed duplicate is reported explicitly.

**The inverse is the hazard.** Transaction identity is
`sender:recipient:amount:fee:timestamp` at one-second granularity, with no nonce, so two
GENUINELY DISTINCT payments that share all five fields are the same transaction and only
one of them happens. `already_pending` therefore means *either* your own retry *or* a
second payment that collided. Compare the returned `tx_id` against the one you submitted,
and give a distinct payment a distinct timestamp or fee. See
[docs/EXCHANGE_INTEGRATION.md](docs/EXCHANGE_INTEGRATION.md#two-distinct-payments-can-silently-become-one).
Retries can still receive transient `429` or `503` responses:

    200  {"ok": true, "status": "accepted",         "tx_id": "<opaque id>"}   admitted; announcement scheduled
    200  {"ok": true, "status": "already_pending",  "tx_id": "<opaque id>"}   identical tx already in mempool
    200  {"ok": true, "status": "already_confirmed","tx_id": "<opaque id>",
          "height": <n>, "final": <bool>}                               already in a block
    400  {"error": "transaction rejected: <reason>"}    failed validation OR backpressure
    400  (plain text)  malformed JSON body — NOT the {"error": ...} shape
    415  (plain text)  missing or wrong Content-Type (must be application/json)
    422  (plain text)  well-formed JSON that does not match the transaction shape
    429  {"error": "rate_limited"}                      node-wide submit bucket
    503  {"error": "chain busy, retry shortly"}         chain lock contended

The `400` / `415` / `422` rejections above come from the HTTP layer before the handler runs
and return PLAIN TEXT, not JSON. Only a `400` whose body parses as
`{"error": "transaction rejected: …"}` came from transaction validation — key off the
response's `Content-Type`, not the status alone.

A withdrawal worker should treat `accepted` / `already_pending` / `already_confirmed` all as
success, retry on `503`, and back off on `429`.

`already_pending` does NOT distinguish your own retry from a colliding second payment, and
comparing the returned `tx_id` cannot separate them — the id is a pure function of the five
fields you posted, so it always matches, and a collision is exactly the case where two
distinct payments share those fields. Reserve the 5-tuple client-side before signing; if
`already_pending` returns for a 5-tuple you never submitted, treat it as a collision and
re-sign with a different timestamp rather than marking the payment done. See the
duplicate-identity note above.

### Protected submission (POST /explorer/v2/submit-tx, /explorer/v2/submit-tx-batch)

Additive, versioned endpoints that make the node detect the collision for you when you attach a
required per-withdrawal `idempotency_key`. The legacy endpoints above are unchanged, so upgrading
the node breaks nothing; you opt in by moving to `/v2/` and sending a key. Full integration guidance,
examples, and a reference client are in
[docs/EXCHANGE_INTEGRATION.md](docs/EXCHANGE_INTEGRATION.md#protected-submission-recommended-let-the-node-detect-collisions-for-you).

Single body: `{"idempotency_key": "<uuid>", "transaction": { …signed-tx… }}`. Batch body:
`{"version": 1, "transactions": [{"idempotency_key": "<uuid>", "transaction": {…}}, …]}` (max 256),
one key per item. Keys must be 16–128 printable-ASCII characters and **unguessable** (UUIDv4) or
scoped to an authenticated client — a predictable key on a reachable endpoint lets someone pre-claim
it and deny your withdrawal.

The key/transaction binding is fsynced **before** admission. If that durable reservation fails, the
node returns `503 ledger_unavailable` and does not admit the transaction. Replays are reconciled
against current canonical pending/confirmed state rather than trusting a cached ledger status.

Beyond the legacy `accepted` / `already_pending` / `already_confirmed` statuses (a replay also carries
`idempotent_replay: true`), the protected path adds four `409` outcomes:

    409 {"status":"idempotency_conflict","original_tx_id":"…"}
        the key is already bound to a DIFFERENT transaction — reuse a key only to retry the exact
        same withdrawal
    409 {"status":"transaction_collision","colliding_tx_id":"…"}
        another withdrawal key already submitted byte-identical transaction bytes; two distinct
        withdrawals collided — rebuild and re-sign THIS one with a new timestamp, then resubmit
    409 {"status":"existing_transaction_unattributed","tx_id":"…"}
        the identical transaction was already pending/confirmed through legacy HTTP, P2P, or another
        path before v2 could bind it to this key; do not mark paid and do not re-sign blindly —
        reconcile it against your withdrawal records
    409 {"status":"historical_outcome_unavailable","last_observed_height":123}
        the ledger previously observed confirmation, but the bounded canonical replay index no
        longer retains this old transaction; verify it in your own durable withdrawal history

    503 {"status":"ledger_unavailable"}  the operator payment ledger could not be opened; the
        legacy endpoints still work, but protected submission is disabled until it can

On any `409`, do not mark the withdrawal paid automatically. The endpoints require the ledger; if it
cannot be opened or a new reservation cannot be fsynced they return `503` without admitting a new
payment. A `503 submission_outcome_unknown` is stricter: retry only the exact same key and signed
transaction until reconciled; never re-sign in response to it.

The node ledger is a safety layer, not the exchange's permanent withdrawal database. Terminal
bindings are retained for seven days and may be pruned earlier under the hard 100,000-entry / 256 MiB
live-state limits; pending, reserved, or ambiguous payments are never evicted to make room, and new
protected submissions fail closed if only non-terminal entries remain. Persist every
withdrawal-to-key-to-transaction mapping in your own database and never reuse a key. Once a terminal
binding is pruned, the node no longer promises idempotency history for it. Separately, the canonical
replay index retains only the transaction-validity window; a bound confirmation older than that
returns `historical_outcome_unavailable` instead of trusting a stale cached result.

**Backpressure is a `429`; a terminal rejection is a `400`.** Admission backpressure —
the per-address pending cap, the per-sender submission rate, and a full mempool — is
returned as HTTP `429` with a machine-readable body, so you branch on a field, not on a
string:

    429 {"error":"rate_limited","reason":"per_address_pending_cap",
         "retryable":true,"retry_same_transaction":true,"detail":"…"}
        RETRYABLE — at the 100-pending-per-sender-address cap; back off and resend the SAME
        signed transaction, the slots drain as blocks land
    429 {"error":"rate_limited","reason":"per_sender_rate",
         "retryable":true,"retry_same_transaction":true,"detail":"…"}
        RETRYABLE — per-sender submission rate; back off and resend the SAME signed transaction
    429 {"error":"rate_limited","reason":"mempool_full",
         "retryable":false,"retry_same_transaction":false,"detail":"…"}
        NOT retryable as-is — back off, then RE-SIGN AT A HIGHER FEE; eviction is fee-ordered
        and all-or-nothing, so resubmitting the identical transaction can never win a slot

`retryable` mirrors `retry_same_transaction`, so a worker can branch on the top-level flag
alone: it is `false` for `mempool_full` because only a re-sign at a higher fee — a different
transaction — can ever clear it.

Every `400 "transaction rejected: …"` is terminal — `Insufficient funds for the
transaction`, `Transaction signature is invalid or missing`, `Transaction fee below the relay
floor (min …)`, `Transaction amount is invalid or negative` — alert on it.

A separate `429` comes from a NODE-WIDE submission token bucket (5/s sustained, burst 20)
shared by every sender regardless of the per-sender limit. It carries no `reason` field and
is always retryable.

On `accepted`, the node has admitted the tx to its mempool (after full signature,
balance, replay, and already-confirmed checks) and scheduled its network
announcement. It is then eligible for miner consideration. There is no separate
confirmation step; poll
`/explorer/tx?id=` with the returned `tx_id` (it reports `pending` then
`confirmed` with a rising `confirmations` count), or watch `/explorer/address`
for the sender/recipient, to see it land in a block.

Treat the returned `tx_id` as an opaque string, not a hex digest. URL-encode it
when passing it to `/explorer/tx?id=...`; its current representation contains
transaction fields and separators and may change independently of API clients.

### Signing (client side — you build this)

Transactions are signed with **ML-DSA-87 (FIPS 204)**, a standardized
post-quantum signature with implementations in multiple ecosystems (e.g.
`@noble/post-quantum`'s `ml_dsa87` in JS/TS) — so no code from this repo is
needed. A wallet must sign **client-side** so the private key never leaves the
device.

**See [`SIGNING_SPEC.md`](SIGNING_SPEC.md)** for the exact signed-message format,
key/signature encodings, and a deterministic test vector to validate your
implementation byte-for-byte. In short: sign the UTF-8 string
`sender:recipient:amount:fee:timestamp` (amount/fee at 8 decimals) with
ML-DSA-87, then POST the transaction JSON to `/explorer/submit-tx`.

This repo intentionally ships no wallet UI. The signing spec defines the
network-facing key, address, message, and transaction encodings an integration
must reproduce.

## Notes for exchanges

See [docs/EXCHANGE_INTEGRATION.md](docs/EXCHANGE_INTEGRATION.md) for asset identity
(ticker, decimals, network id), the scheduled consensus activations, withdrawal queue
limits, deposit-scanner pitfalls, and node operational requirements.

- Run a dedicated node with the API enabled behind your own proxy/auth.
- Deposits: watch `/explorer/address/{your_deposit_addrs}` (balance + history),
  or scan blocks via `/explorer/block/{height}`.
- Withdrawals: sign server-side (HSM/keystore) and POST to `/explorer/submit-tx`.
- Always reconcile with `*_units` integers, and wait the confirmations your risk
  model requires (the node advances a finality checkpoint behind the tip).
