# Exchange integration

Companion to [`EXPLORER_API.md`](../EXPLORER_API.md), which documents the endpoints, the
finality model, and the signing contract. This file covers what a listing team and a
withdrawal engineer need that the endpoint reference does not: asset identity, the
scheduled consensus activations, the failure modes that cost money, and the operational
shape of running a node.

## Asset identity

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Asset name | alphanumeric |
| Ticker | `ALPHA` |
| Display glyph | `♦` |
| Decimals | 8 |
| Smallest unit | 1 `ALPHA` = 100,000,000 units |
| Address format | 40 lowercase hex characters, `SHA256(public_key)[..20]` |
| Network id | `66b401a212ee9cddab38ff73176a3eeca1733ac81a912376b63aa11afdd1e78c` |
| Signature scheme | ML-DSA-87 (post-quantum), signature 4,627 B, public key 2,592 B |
| Target block time | 5 s (measured ~5.4 s) |
| Finality margin | 64 blocks (~6 min) |

`network_id` is the launch genesis hash and is served by `/explorer/status`. Verify it on
connect: it is the only field that distinguishes this chain from a fork or a testnet that
shares the same address and transaction format.

Amounts appear twice in every response: a decimal string (`amount`) and an exact integer
(`amount_units`). **Reconcile on `*_units` only.** The decimal form exists for display.

## Scheduled consensus activations

Both are compiled into the binary. There is nothing to configure; you need the right
release before the height arrives.

| Height | ~Date | Change | Minimum release |
|---:|---|---|---|
| 517,583 | 2026-08-10 | Fee accounting arms: block-level net-issuance cap | v7.9.3 |
| 569,423 | 2026-08-13 | Reward curve V2: a block carrying transactions no longer pays less than an empty one | **v7.9.4** |

A node older than the required release computes a different coinbase from that height and
stops following the chain. Build from the release tag, not from `main`.

Between 517,583 and 569,423 the fee-accounting baseline uses a compatibility envelope, so
blocks carrying many minimum-fee transactions can be rejected with
`FeeAccountingLimitExceeded`. This affects miners building templates, not exchanges
submitting transactions.

## Withdrawals

### Two distinct payments can silently become one

Transaction identity is `sender:recipient:amount:fee:timestamp` with the timestamp at
**one-second granularity**. There is no nonce or sequence number.

So two genuinely separate withdrawals with the same sender, recipient, amount and fee,
signed within the same second, are **the same transaction**. The second is absorbed as a
duplicate and only one payment happens.

The node tells you, but not with an error:

```json
200  {"ok": true, "status": "already_pending",
      "hint": "identical transaction already pending; a distinct payment must differ in timestamp, amount, or fee"}
```

**A worker that checks only the HTTP status and `ok` will record two successful payouts
and send one.** Branch on `status`:

| `status` | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `accepted` | new transaction admitted |
| `already_pending` | **either** your own retry, **or** a distinct payment that collided |
| `already_confirmed` | already mined |

`already_pending` means the node already holds a transaction with your exact five identity
fields. It **cannot** tell you whether that is your own retry or a colliding second payment,
and comparing the returned `tx_id` does not help: `get_tx_id` is a pure function of the five
fields you just posted, so the returned id always equals the one you submitted — and a
collision is by definition two payments whose five fields are identical, which is precisely
when the ids match.

The defence has to be client-side. **Reserve the 5-tuple (sender, recipient, amount, fee,
timestamp) in your own store before signing**, and refuse to issue a second withdrawal that
reuses one. If `already_pending` comes back for a 5-tuple you have not previously submitted,
treat it as a COLLISION: do not mark the withdrawal paid — re-sign with a different
timestamp (wait one second) or vary the fee by one unit. Serialising withdrawals to one per
second per (recipient, amount) pair is the simplest correct policy.

### Protected submission (recommended): let the node detect collisions for you

The client-side defense above still works and is unchanged. But the node can now do the detection
for you if you give it the one thing only your system has — a unique id per withdrawal.

Use the **protected** endpoints and attach an `idempotency_key` (your own withdrawal id) to every
submission:

- `POST /explorer/v2/submit-tx`
- `POST /explorer/v2/submit-tx-batch`

The rule is one line:

> Generate one unique, unguessable key per withdrawal. Send it with the transaction. Reuse the same
> key **only** when retrying that exact withdrawal.

Single submission:

```json
POST /explorer/v2/submit-tx
{
  "idempotency_key": "d2c0ef48-849a-4ce8-b67c-04fd7fc8e017",
  "transaction": {
    "sender": "<40-char hex>", "recipient": "<40-char hex>",
    "amount": 10, "fee": 0.0001, "timestamp": 1786752000,
    "signature": "<hex>", "pub_key": "<hex>", "sig_hash": "<hex>"
  }
}
```

Batch — every item carries its own key:

```json
POST /explorer/v2/submit-tx-batch
{
  "version": 1,
  "transactions": [
    { "idempotency_key": "<uuid-1>", "transaction": { … } },
    { "idempotency_key": "<uuid-2>", "transaction": { … } }
  ]
}
```

The node evaluates four cases and answers unambiguously:

| Your submission | `status` | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| new key, transaction absent before v2 reservation | `accepted` | admitted and attributed to this key |
| same key, same recent transaction | `already_pending`/`already_confirmed`, `idempotent_replay: true` | safe retry — canonically reconciled, never a second payment |
| same key, cached confirmation older than the canonical replay window | `historical_outcome_unavailable` (HTTP 409) | the node will not trust stale cached state — reconcile from your withdrawal database |
| same key, different transaction | `idempotency_conflict` (HTTP 409) | you reused a withdrawal id for a different transaction — refused |
| different key, identical transaction | `transaction_collision` (HTTP 409) | two of your withdrawals produced identical bytes and collided |
| new key, transaction already present outside v2 | `existing_transaction_unattributed` (HTTP 409) | the node cannot safely attribute the pre-existing payment to this withdrawal |

The last row is the case you could not previously detect: two byte-identical transactions carrying
two different withdrawal ids are two distinct payments, and without the two ids the node cannot tell
them from one transaction submitted twice. On `transaction_collision`, re-sign the colliding
withdrawal (advance its timestamp by one second or change the fee by one unit) and resubmit it under
its own key. The rejected collision attempt does not claim that key, so this corrected resubmission is
allowed. On any `409`, do **not** mark the withdrawal paid until you resolve it.

`existing_transaction_unattributed` is deliberately conservative. It occurs when the identical
transaction reached this node through the legacy endpoint, P2P, or another path before the protected
endpoint could durably associate it with your key. It may be your earlier submission, or it may be a
distinct colliding withdrawal. Do not re-sign blindly (both transactions could then confirm); compare
the transaction with your durable withdrawal history and resolve the attribution first. For the full
guarantee, send a withdrawal through v2 on its **first** submission and retry that same node/key/tx.

The node fsyncs the key-to-transaction reservation before canonical admission. A reservation failure
returns `503 ledger_unavailable` without admitting a new transaction. Replays are reconciled with
the node's current confirmed and durable/in-memory pending state while those canonical indexes retain
the transaction; old cached confirmations fail closed as described below. If an admission error
cannot be reconciled, the node returns
`503 submission_outcome_unknown`; retry only the exact same key and signed transaction and never
re-sign until the outcome is known.

The node ledger is a bounded safety layer, not your permanent withdrawal database. Terminal bindings
are retained for seven days and can be pruned earlier under the hard 100,000-entry / 256 MiB live-state
limits; reserved, pending, and ambiguous payments are never evicted to make room, and new protected
submissions fail closed if capacity is exhausted by non-terminal operations. Keep the withdrawal id,
key, signed transaction, and final outcome in your own durable store and never reuse a key. Once a
terminal binding is pruned, the node no longer provides idempotency history for it. Separately, the
canonical replay index retains only the transaction-validity window; if the ledger remembers an older
confirmation that the index can no longer prove, the endpoint returns
`historical_outcome_unavailable` for manual reconciliation instead of trusting stale cached state.

A transaction that was definitively not admitted does not retain a binding, so a corrected
transaction (including a higher-fee rebuild after `mempool_full`) may reuse that withdrawal's key.
Once a key has a live, confirmed, or ambiguous binding, a different transaction under it is an
`idempotency_conflict`.

**Security — keys must be unguessable.** The submission endpoint may be reachable by more than your
backend. A predictable key such as `withdrawal-1234` lets someone else claim it first and make your
real withdrawal fail with `idempotency_conflict`. Use a UUIDv4 (or another high-entropy value), or
scope keys to an authenticated API client. Keys must be 16–128 printable-ASCII characters; the node
rejects shorter or malformed ones.

**Migration is deliberate; existing integrations are untouched.** The legacy `submit-tx` and
`submit-tx-batch` endpoints are unchanged, so upgrading the node breaks nothing. You gain this
protection when you point your withdrawal worker at the `/v2/` endpoints and start sending a key —
not merely by upgrading. That participation is unavoidable: the withdrawal id is information only
your system has, so the node cannot supply it for you.

If you instead sign with the reference wallet (`create`/`send`), you already get collision-free
timestamps automatically — the ledger allocates a distinct timestamp per identical payment — so the
protected endpoints are specifically for integrations that sign in their own service and POST the
finished transaction.

A minimal reference client (Python):

```python
import uuid, requests

def submit_withdrawal(node_url, signed_tx, withdrawal_id=None):
    # Persist `key` next to the withdrawal row BEFORE submitting; reuse it verbatim on retry.
    key = withdrawal_id or str(uuid.uuid4())
    body = requests.post(f"{node_url}/explorer/v2/submit-tx",
                         json={"idempotency_key": key, "transaction": signed_tx}).json()
    status = body.get("status")
    if status in ("accepted", "already_pending"):
        return "submitted", key, body       # safe association; wait for normal confirmation policy
    if status == "already_confirmed":
        return "confirmed", key, body
    if status == "transaction_collision":
        return "rebuild", key, body         # re-sign with a new timestamp, resubmit under the same id
    if status == "idempotency_conflict":
        return "conflict", key, body        # you reused an id for a different tx — investigate
    if status in ("existing_transaction_unattributed", "historical_outcome_unavailable",
                  "submission_outcome_unknown"):
        return "manual_reconcile", key, body # never re-sign while the original may be live
    return "retry_or_reject", key, body     # backpressure (retry) or terminal rejection — inspect body
```

### Queue limits

- **100 concurrently pending transactions per sender address** (`MEMPOOL_MAX_PER_ADDRESS`).
  A hot wallet is one address, so a burst of more than 100 queued withdrawals fails at the
  101st. Cap in-flight submissions below 100, or shard across several hot wallets.
- **2,000 submissions per 60 s per sender address** — ~33 tx/s sustained. (Raised from 100
  in this release: a pool paying its miners in one payout round no longer trips it.)
- The submit endpoint is additionally fronted by a **node-wide** token bucket: 5
  submissions/s sustained, burst 20, shared across every sender regardless of the
  per-sender limit. Exceeding it returns `429 {"error": "rate_limited"}`. This, not the
  per-sender limit, is the ceiling on sustained submission throughput against one node.
- No server-side way to query current mempool depth for your address. Track in-flight
  count client-side.

### Classifying failures

Admission **backpressure** — the per-address pending cap, the per-sender rate, and a full
mempool — is returned as HTTP **429** with a machine-readable body, so you branch on a field
instead of a string:

```json
429 {"error": "rate_limited", "reason": "per_address_pending_cap", "retryable": true, "retry_same_transaction": true, "detail": "…"}
```

| `reason` | `retryable` / `retry_same_transaction` | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `per_address_pending_cap` | yes | at the pending-per-address cap; back off, resend the same signed transaction (slots drain as blocks land) |
| `per_sender_rate` | yes | per-sender submission rate; back off, resend the same signed transaction |
| `mempool_full` | no | **re-sign at a higher fee** — eviction is fee-ordered and all-or-nothing, so resubmitting the identical transaction can never win a slot |

`retryable` mirrors `retry_same_transaction`, so a worker can branch on the top-level flag
alone: it is `false` for `mempool_full` because only a re-sign at a higher fee — a different
transaction — can clear it. A separate node-wide token bucket (5/s sustained, burst 20,
shared across all senders) also returns `429 {"error": "rate_limited"}` with no `reason`; it
is always retryable.

**A `400 {"error": "transaction rejected: …"}` is terminal** — `Insufficient funds`,
`signature is invalid or missing`, `fee below the relay floor`, `amount is invalid or
negative` — alert on it.

Malformed requests are rejected by the HTTP layer before the handler runs and return PLAIN
TEXT, not JSON: `400` for a JSON syntax error, `415` for a missing/wrong `Content-Type`,
`422` for well-formed JSON that is not a transaction. Key off `Content-Type` — only a `400`
whose body parses as `{"error": "transaction rejected: …"}` came from validation.

Minimum relay fee is 10,000 units (0.0001 `ALPHA`). Minimum transfer is 564 units. Use
`/explorer/fee-estimate` rather than hardcoding.

### Fee band caution

Some historical fee values carry an encoding meaning in the reference wallet. Use the fee
returned by `/explorer/fee-estimate`, or the relay floor, and avoid choosing large
arbitrary fee values for ordinary withdrawals.

## Deposits

`/explorer/address/{addr}` returns confirmed ledger state.

This release returns these fields: `address`, `balance`, `balance_units`, `spendable`,
`spendable_units`, `history_available`, `index_ready`, `index_height`, `summary`,
`transactions`, `next`.

**`balance_units` is the raw confirmed ledger total.** It includes mining rewards that are
still immature (coinbase maturity is **100 blocks**) and does not subtract in-flight mempool
debits, so it can exceed what the address can actually spend. For a deposit address that
never mines and that you never spend from concurrently, it is safe to credit against. For
any address you also withdraw from, use `spendable_units` (below) or subtract your own
in-flight debits client-side.

**`spendable` / `spendable_units`** is the precomputed spendable amount — confirmed minus
pending debits minus still-immature mining rewards — or `null` when it cannot be computed.
Prefer it over subtracting your own in-flight debits from `balance_units`.

**Check `history_available` before trusting `transactions`.** The history is served off the
address index, which can be unbuilt or mid-rebuild after a bootstrap or re-index. When it is
not ready, `history_available` is `false` and `transactions` is served as `null` (not an
empty array), so "index not ready" and "no deposits" cannot be confused — a scanner must
refuse to conclude anything about deposits while `history_available` is `false`. Retry until
it is `true`, and also confirm freshness via `/explorer/status` (`blocks_behind`).

`GET` endpoints can return **503** under chain-lock contention during heavy sync/indexing
(`{"error":"chain busy, retry shortly"}`) or when storage/index data cannot be read
(`{"error":"storage_unavailable"}`). A deposit scanner must treat either response as
"retry/alert", never as "no data", or it can skip deposits or accept a false zero.

Credit rules and reorg handling are covered in
[`EXPLORER_API.md`](../EXPLORER_API.md#finality-for-exchanges--credit-deposits-safely).

## Running a node

**The node deliberately terminates itself and must run under a supervisor.** Several
recovery paths call `exit(3)` expecting an external supervisor to restart the process, for
example when the local chain has fallen too far behind to catch up incrementally and needs
to re-bootstrap. Under `nohup` or a bare container with no restart policy, the node stays
down. Use systemd, Docker `restart: always`, launchd `KeepAlive`, or equivalent.

Storage notes:

- The database never shrinks. Deleted data is not reclaimed, and a re-bootstrapped
  database carries permanent import overhead.
- There is no prune mode and no compaction command. Provision for monotonic growth and
  re-bootstrap from a snapshot if a node's database becomes unwieldy.
- Bootstrap downloads a signed snapshot; check
  `https://alphanumeric.blue/api/bootstrap/manifest` for the current size before
  provisioning.

Bind the API to loopback and put your own auth in front of it. It has no authentication of
its own.

## Capabilities this chain does not have

| Capability | Status |
|---|---|
| Memo / destination tag | **None.** Use one deposit address per user; there is no shared-address tagging. |
| Batch withdrawal (one transaction, many recipients) | **None.** Send N separate transactions; the miner template drains many transactions per sender per block, so this works, subject to the 100-pending cap. |
| Fee bump / RBF | **None.** A stuck transaction is replaced by signing a distinct one (different timestamp or fee). |
| Mempool acceptance query | **None.** Submission response is the acceptance signal. |
| Block or deposit webhooks | No per-address webhooks and no outbound HTTP from the node. There IS a tip push: `ALPHANUMERIC_BLOCKNOTIFY="/path/to/script %s %h"` runs your command on every new tip (`%s` hash, `%h` height) — Bitcoin Core's `-blocknotify` contract. When a program path or argument contains spaces, use structured argv, for example `ALPHANUMERIC_BLOCKNOTIFY_ARGV='["C:\\Program Files\\Pool\\notify.exe","%s","%h"]'`; it takes precedence over the legacy variable and still executes directly without a shell. Built for pools, but it suits a deposit scanner just as well: trigger a block-walk on the hook instead of polling `/explorer/tip`. Single-flight, coalesces under load, killed after 10 s. |
| HD derivation standard | **None** published. Post-quantum keys do not use BIP32-style derivation. |
| Multisig | **None.** |
